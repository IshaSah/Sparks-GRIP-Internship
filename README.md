# Sparks-GRIP-Internship
TASK 1:
   - A dataset was given to us with two attributes Hours and Scores. These are the findings:
   -  This dataset had zero null values. 
   -  Our task was to perform liner regression to the dataset and predict the Score of a student against the no.of hours he studied.
   -   This model was successfully developed with an accuracy of 95.6%. 
   -   We also performed evaluation tests on our model. The model has a good R2 value which suggests goodness of the fit.
   -    Thus, the task was successful.
